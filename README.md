## Statement
This project aims to determine which disease a patient is most susceptible to based on demographic parameters compared to a given dataset. 
## Technology
1. MySQL database to connect a medical dataset.
2. Flask to connect the MySQL database with our front-end website
3. Jinja2 to render dynamic HTML webapages.
4. Random Forest Algorithm that will calculate the probabilities of a disease based on the dataset given.
   
## How to run the project:
  1. Download the "final" folder
  2. Download an IDE. The one that we used in Visual Studio code, which can be downloaded for free on the following link: https://code.visualstudio.com
  3. Download Python: which can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  4. For package requirements, please check the requirements file.
  5. Download Mysql workbench, and create a user

Once these requirements are satisfied, you can open the main file, change the mysql username if different, change your mysql password, and turn on the msql server.

then, you can run the main file in your IDE, and connect to the website by opening your browser and opening the following link: localhost:4560/

This should open the Website.
