We want to do a project in the medical field where we create a model that determines which disease a patient 
is most likely to get based on certain parameters when compared to given dataset. We will be using MySQL database to 
connect a medical dataset. We will also be using tools such as Flask to connect the MySQL database with our front end
website, which will be HTML based. Finally, we will be implementing a nurel net model that will calculate the probabilities 
of a disease based on the dataset given.
